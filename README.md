Welcome to the future of automation!
The Systematic Automation Engine is an ambitious project to revolutionize how we interact with repetitive tasks, bridging the gap between manual automation and intelligent task orchestration. This tool isn't just about automating tasks‚Äîit's about automating automation itself.

üåå Vision
Imagine a world where:

Tasks don‚Äôt need to be manually scripted anymore; drag-and-drop workflows create automations intuitively.
Thousands of nodes collaborate to execute tasks at scale, each rewarded with decentralized tokens for their contributions.
Automation tools empower users globally, saving time and unlocking human creativity.
The Systematic Automation Engine aims to:

Simplify automation creation: Provide an intuitive interface where users design and share their workflows.
Enable collaboration: Build a decentralized network where individuals can share, improve, and reuse automations.
Incorporate AI intelligence: Allow AI to assist in crafting and optimizing workflows for maximum efficiency.
Reward contributions: Introduce a token system (e.g., TimeCoin) to incentivize collaboration and participation.
üõ†Ô∏è Current Features
1. Task Execution Engine
Execute a series of tasks defined by users.
Supports basic web interactions like:
Opening websites
Clicking buttons
Filling forms
Taking screenshots
2. Distributed Task Handling
Multiple worker nodes run in parallel, ensuring tasks are executed efficiently.
The central coordinator distributes tasks and collects results.
3. Event Recording & Task Creation
A foundation for recording events, paving the way for drag-and-drop automation creation.
Users can define tasks programmatically for now, but future plans include a user-friendly interface.
4. Reward System
A placeholder reward system to track and distribute rewards for completing tasks.
üéØ Roadmap
Observation Layer (In Progress):

Record user interactions to simplify task creation.
Support complex event handling and task chaining.
Drag-and-Drop Task Builder:

Allow users to create workflows visually.
Automations will be collaborative and shareable across the decentralized network.
AI-Assisted Automation:

Integrate machine learning models to generate and optimize workflows.
Suggest the best automation for a given task.
Integration with Decentralized Network:

Connect with the TimeCoin network to reward contributors and ensure automation security.
Modular Extensions:

Add support for custom workflows, APIs, and IoT devices.
